Hey! I finally got this thing working the way I wanted it to! And it's only midnight!

I started this blog to share my many interests with the masses. Video game releases, 
new technology, programming tutorials, current events... you know, boring stuff like 
that. If any of that sounds remotely interesting to you, please stay tuned! If you 
want to know more about me, check out my [about me page](/about)! I plan on creating at least 
one post per week... probably on the weekends... or not, it really depends on how I'm 
feeling. Stay awesome readers!
