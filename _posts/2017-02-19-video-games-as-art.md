One of the earliest memories I can recall is watching my oldest cousin playing 
video games. I remember sitting in my grandmother's apartment, watching him 
playing Metroid on the NES and being amazed at the colors and sounds that would 
eminate from the (then brand new) CRT Sony television set. That was my first encounter 
with video games.

The obsession only grew in 1998, when my grandfather bought my sister and I a Nintendo 
64 (admittedly I was the one who played it more). When I first fired up the now 
beyond obsolete console and started to play The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, 
I knew that these small plastic cartridges would always be a part of my life. 

The cartridge era of video games came and went; the format had changed, yet I was 
fascinated and entertained by them - but that was it. Back then, I valued the medium 
only by how much fun I had playing a game. While that is certainly a large part 
of how I guage a game now, I like to think the years have given me a little bit more 
of a perspective.

The debate on weather games can be considered as works of art has been going on for 
decades, and though now many will agree with me, saying in a definitive tone, "yes, 
they can be art," that is not what this post is about. No, what I want to talk to 
about (and what is arguably more intersting) is when *I* finally realized that video 
games can be art.

Fast forward to 2013. Yes, yes, I can already hear you saying - "Allen, that's only 
four years ago!" Well, this wasn't the first time I had considered a game to have 
good artwork, or an incredible story, but this time, it was something different. It 
is often said that what is considered "good" art should carry some kind of emotional 
power. Well, I believe that Naughty Dog Studio's, "The Last Of Us", does precisely that.

For those of you who have not played it, watch the first fifteen minutes of the game 
and you will instantly understand what I am talking about.

"The Last Of Us" does something that sets itself apart from other zombie survival 
horror games in the past. For most of the game, players control Joel, a man tasked 
with accompanying a young girl, Ellie (who is immune to the infection), across the 
United States. At first glance this mechanic seems like just another extra long and 
super annoying escort quest, but as the game progresses and you see the relationship 
between Joel and Ellie develop, you begin to see that it is so much more than that.

Right from the beginning, "The Last of Us" hits you with an incredibly powerful and 
emotional punch to the gut. At the beginning of the story, Joel loses his daughter in 
the early stages of the outbreak. It's not a coincidence that Ellie is around her age.

The interaction between Joel and Ellie feels incredibly human. Of course, the natural 
performances of the voice actors and the seemingly random organic dialogue between them 
help drive this feeling home, but it's also through the personal level of interaction 
that one can usually only find in a video game.

Most games that have been released in recent years have touted the ability to allow 
players to create their own narrative. In turn, this enables players to project their 
own personalities and feelings on to the avatars they play as to fabricate their own 
story into the game.

However, with "The Last of Us", the narrative is carefully woven with scenes of emotionally 
charged human interaction that compliments the gameplay.

It's no surprise then that when we are presented with Joel and Ellie's story, that by 
the end of the game we find ourselves having physical reactions to the game's events. 
In my first playthrough of the game, I caught myself gasping, laughing, and, yes, even 
getting choked up at certain scenes of the game.

Although video games may not be considered by art by some critics, they are certainly 
on the path towards achieving this status, and for me they already have been for some years. 
However, one thing is for sure, "The Last of Us" is certainly an experience that I will never 
forget. Stay awesome readers!
