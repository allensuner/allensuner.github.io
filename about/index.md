Hey - I'm Allen Suner, a software engineer and teacher from Seattle, Washington.
On any given day you can find me programming, reading comic books, listening to old house records,
or playing final fantasy. I love to travel (though I haven't been to many places). I have been to most of North America and some of the Middle East.
