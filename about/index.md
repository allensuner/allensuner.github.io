Hey - I'm Allen Suner, a software engineer and teacher from Seattle! In the wild 
you can find me programming, reading comic books, listening to old house records, 
or playing final fantasy.

What's that you ask? Why did you choose to waste your time writing words that most 
people won't read? Why are you talking to yourself in the "about me" section? It's 
a little clich√©, you say? Well, aren't you an opinionated little...

\*Ahem* _Sorry about that._

Anyway - about a month ago, I figured I should start jotting my thoughts down on 
paper. But then I thought, "Why the hell would I something on paper, I know something 
about computers! I should try my hand at this CSS thing I have been hearing about!"
So here we are - nearly a month later, and I still know little to nothing about CSS.

When I'm not stumbling my way through web design, I promise I am a half-way decent 
programmer. I studied Computer Science at Western Washington University. Two years 
ago, I became a Software Engineer at Expedia Inc., specializing in making stuff 
go by itself. At work, I write software to automate tasks that developers and engineers 
usually have to do manually.

When I'm not working for the "proverbial" man, I plan extravagant vacations around 
the world I will never take. However, on the rare occassion I have traveled 
internationally, my adventures brought me to the Middle East. Right before I started 
my job at Expedia, I traipsed around Israel, Jordan, and Turkey by myself on a quest 
to snap all of the most tourist-y photos I could. Look - here are some now!
